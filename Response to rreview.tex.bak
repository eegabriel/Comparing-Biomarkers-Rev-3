\maketitle
We are happy to have the opportunity to revise our manuscript. We have put forth considerable effort to address reviewer 2's comments and we feel that the paper has improved greatly. We have made some critical revisions to the methods section, and have modified the real-data example to better illustrate our proposed methods. Below we outline the specific changes. 

\section{Response Reviewer 2}
\begin{enumerate}
I have to admit that I am somewhat disappointed with this revision.

Only minor changes in the essential section 2 have been made.

The paper is still not sufficiently self-contained and one has to read at least [1] and [10] to have a chance at understanding what’s going on in the paper. Both [1] and [10] are very nice and interesting papers by the way.

The extension from [10] in terms of modelling is straightforward and minor.

The tools developed to assess and select one or more surrogates are problematic at least to me as they include the subjective choice of one or more time points at which performance is evaluated. Also, the actual selection of an optimal subset of surrogates is not well described.

It would be ideal with an example where these extensions really mattered.
\end{enumerate}
