\maketitle
We are happy to have the opportunity to revise our manuscript. We have put forth considerable effort to address reviewer 2's comments and we feel that the paper has improved greatly. We have made some critical revisions to the methods section, and have modified the real-data example to better illustrate our proposed methods. Below we outline the specific changes. 

\section{Comments from Reviewer 2}
\begin{quotation}
I have to admit that I am somewhat disappointed with this revision.

Only minor changes in the essential section 2 have been made.

The paper is still not sufficiently self-contained and one has to read at least [1] and [10] to have a chance at understanding what’s going on in the paper. Both [1] and [10] are very nice and interesting papers by the way.

The extension from [10] in terms of modelling is straightforward and minor.

The tools developed to assess and select one or more surrogates are problematic at least to me as they include the subjective choice of one or more time points at which performance is evaluated. Also, the actual selection of an optimal subset of surrogates is not well described.

It would be ideal with an example where these extensions really mattered.
\end{quotation}

\section{Response to Reviewer 2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We reorganized the methods into sections 2 and 3. Section 2 now contains the notation and background information on the concept of principal surrogacy. This section provides a more thorough introduction so that uninitiated readers may better understand without referring to [1] or [10]. 
\item The remaining subsections of the methods have been reorganized so that the concepts flow more naturally from defining estimands of interest, to assumptions, to modeling, to estimation, to summary statistics, and finally to PS comparison. 
\item We have added an additional subsection where we introduce the integrated standardized total gain to address reviewer 2's concerns about the subjective choice of time points.  The integrated STG does not require the analyst to specify a time point, but rather averages the time dependent STG with respect to the distribution of event times. We suggest estimating the marginal distribution of event times with the Kaplan-Meier estimator. We evaluate the integrated STG in the simulations and demonstrate its operating characteristics. The integrated STG tends to have slightly higher power for comparison of candidate PS as compared to the STG at a single time point. 
\item In regard to the reviewer's comment about selecting the optimal subset of surrogates, we have revised section 3.7 to more clearly describe the hypothesis tests that are used to rule out useless PS from consideration. Selecting an optimal (in some sense) subset from a large set of candidates in this context is an interesting research problem that is beyond the scope of the current paper. 
\item We have modified the example to better illustrate our extensions. We created a third candidate PS from a linear combination of the two real candidate PS such that the PS has some value as a surrogate, but with a significantly smaller STG. In this case the test for the difference in STG yields evidence of a difference between the two surrogates where standard hypothesis testing could not. This makes the example more of a toy example, in that we modified the data generation process, but we feel that it does provide a better illustration of where our proposed methods actually matter. 
\item We have added an additional paragraph to the summary of the simulation studies to clarify one point. Briefly, models with multivariate candidate PS require more information for estimation (in terms of the correlation with the BIP). In some scenarios with low correlation, the algorithm failed to converge for up to 25\% of the replicates. The EM algorithm as suggested by [1] converges more reliably, yet has slightly more bias. These concerns do not apply to scenarios similar to the one in the example. A brief summary of the EM approach was also added to the methods section.
\end{enumerate}

We thank you again for the thoughtful review; the paper has improved greatly thanks to your efforts.
